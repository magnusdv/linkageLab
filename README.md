Linkage Lab: Kinship testing with linked markers
================

<!-- README.md is generated from README.Rmd. Please edit that file -->

## Overview

Linkage Lab is an interactive Shiny app for exploring how genetic
linkage between markers affects likelihood ratios (LR) in kinship
testing.

For a given pedigree comparison the app shows how the LR for a pair of
markers is influenced by:

- the observed genotypes
- recombination rate between the markers
- the allele frequencies
- the mutation rate

The app is built on the
[pedsuite](https://magnusdv.github.io/pedsuite/).

## Comparisons included

- Duo – Unrelated  
- Sibs – Unrelated  
- Half sibs – Unrelated

- Avuncular – Unrelated
- Duo – Sibs
- Sibs – Half sibs  
- Grandparent – Half sibs  
- Avuncular – Half sibs
